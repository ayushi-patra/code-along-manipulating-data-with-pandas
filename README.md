An introduction to the Facebook advertising platform
Along with Google's search and display networks, Facebook is one of the big players when it comes to online advertising. As Facebook users interact with the platform, adding demographic information, liking particular pages and commenting on specific posts, Facebook builds a profile of that user based on who they are and what they're interested in.

This fact makes Facebook very attractive for advertisers. Advertisers can create Facebook adverts, then create an 'Audience' for that advert or group of adverts. Audiences can be built from a range of attributes including gender, age, location and interests. This specific targetting means advertisers can tailor content appropriately for a specific audience, even if the product being marketed is the same.
